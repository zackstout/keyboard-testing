# Keyboard Words
Checking (among the 10,000 most common English words) how many can be typed with only one hand. Also checking for the Dvorak keyboard.

Idea: optimize the keyboard around maximizing number of one-hand-typable words.

Current record is 815 words, with the good old AEFGJLNORSTXY keyboard (compared to 547 for QWERTY).

Whoa, 1552 with the ADEFHIKLNORST!
